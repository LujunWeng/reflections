###**When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?**
If there are several people working on a project at the same time, it would be best to use a remote repository and keep the remote up-to-date.
So if someone need the latest version of this project, he must pull the project from the remote repository first. 
Also, if I am working on a project from different devices, then using a remote repository would be very helpful.
