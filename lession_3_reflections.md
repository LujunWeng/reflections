###**When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?**
If there are several people working on a project at the same time, it would be best to use a remote repository and keep the remote up-to-date.
So if someone need the latest version of this project, he must pull the project from the remote repository first.
Also, if I am working on a project from different devices, then using a remote repository would be very helpful.

###**Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?**

Basically, the remote repository is not always the latest version.

Usually, we would like make modifications locally and want to push changes to the remote repository. If Git automatically stay up-to-date with the remote, the local changes will disappear when sync with the remote.
