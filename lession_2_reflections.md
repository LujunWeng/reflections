###**What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?**
1. It creates the `.git` folder for this repository and creates no commit.
2. Because in this way `Git` can have what it should need to track the folder or the project.

###**How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?**
The staging area contains files which will be tracked in the next commit, while the working directory contains all the files and folders in the directory, and the repository is a collection that `git` operates on for version controls.
